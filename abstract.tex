  The main goal of this thesis is to define an extension of GÃ¶del
  not-not translation to all truncated types, in the setting of
  homotopy type theory. This goal will be achieved using the
  Lawvere-Tierney sheaves theory, by extending and formalizing the
  Lawvere-Tierney sheafification functor.

  The definition of this functor needs concepts that were not defined
  in homotopy type theory, such as colimits over graphs and truncated modalities.
  
  Almost all results presented in this thesis are formalized with the
  proof assistant Coq.
